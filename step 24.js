/*
Step 24
In the last few steps, you learned all about working with arrays. Take a moment to review what you have learned.

Start by declaring a cities variable and initializing it as an array of the strings "London", "New York", and "Mumbai". Then log that variable to the console.

After logging, change the last element of cities to the string "Mexico City", then log the cities variable again.

When done correctly, you should see this output in the console.

Example Code
[ "London", "New York", "Mumbai" ]
[ "London", "New York", "Mexico City" ]
*/

let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
let cities = ['London', 'New York', 'Mumbai'];

console.log(cities);
cities[cities.length -1] = 'Mexico City';
console.log(cities);


console.log(rows);
